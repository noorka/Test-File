            <p>Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing, and the frame of the window was made of black ebony. And whilst she was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself, <quote source="Snow-White’s_Mother">Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood of the window-frame.</quote></p>
            <p>Soon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony: and she was therefore called <persName ref="Personography.xml#Snow_White">Little Snow-White</persName>. And when the child was born, the Queen died.</p>
            <p>After a year had passed the King took himself <persName ref="Personography.xml#Evil_Queen">another wife</persName>.<note>This scene is removed from the story. No mention is made of Snow White's mother or how she came to be red as blood, white as snow and as black as ebony wood.</note> She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty.<note>It is mentioned in the opening storybook sequence that the Evil Queen forced Snow White to be a scullery maid.</note> She had a wonderful looking-glass<note>The Queen refers to this as her Magic Mirror. In other versions of the story this can be different.</note>, and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it and said --</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote></p><pb n="323" facs="GrimmSnow323.JPG"/>
            <p>the looking-glass answered—</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!</hi></quote></p>
            <p>Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke the truth.<note>This first scene with the mirror is not present in the film.</note></p>
            <p>But Snow-White was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old<note>Though not explicitly stated in the movie, in the Disney cannon Snow White is 14 years old.</note> she was as beautiful as the day, and more beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the Queen asked her looking-glass--</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote><note>This invocation is changed to: "Slave in the mogic mirror come from a farther space, through wind and darkness I summon thee. Speak, let me see thy face." The mirror responds, "What wouldst thou know my queen?" To which she requests, "Magic Mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"</note></p>
            <p>it answered—</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen.<lb/>But more beautiful still is Snow-White, as I ween.</hi></quote><note>The mirror responds with, "Famed is thy beauty, Majesty, but ho a lovely maid I see. Rags cannot hide her gentle grace, she is more fair than thee." The Queen rebutts, "Alas for her, reveal her name." The Mirror finally replys, "Lips red as the rose, hair black as ebony, skin white as snow." The Queen comes to her own conclusion announcing, "Snow White!"</note></p>
            <p>Then the Queen was shocked, and turned blue and green with envy. From that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-White, her heart heaved in her breast, she hated the girl so much.<note>The scene then shifts to Snow White scrubbing the stairs in the court yard and singing with doves about wishing for her true love to come find her. During this song a prince hears her and climbs over the wall of the palace to sing with her. Snow White is frightened, but then charmed by this prince.</note></p>
            <p>And envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed, so that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">Take the child away into the forest; I will no longer have her in my sight. Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a token.</quote></p>
            <p>The huntsman obeyed,<note>The Huntsman is first repulsed by the idea, but then relents to the desires of the Queen.</note> and took her away; but when he had drawn his knife, and was about to pierce Snow-White’s innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, <quote source="Snow-White">Ah, dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.</quote><note>Snow White only cowers and does not ask for her life to be spared. She is saved by the Huntsman's kindness and lack of conviction.</note></p>
            <p>And as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, <quote source="Huntsman">Run away then, you poor child.<note>The Huntsman explains to Snow White that her step-mother is jealous and desires her to be killed.</note> The wild beasts will soon have devoured you,</quote> thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her. And as a young boar just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its heart and took it to the Queen as proof the child was dead. The cook had to salt this, and the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the heart of Snow-White.</p>
            <p>But now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not know what<pb n="324" facs="GrimmSnow324.JPG"/> to do. Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.<note>She also falls into a swamp and has many other frightening encounters with the local flora.</note> She ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening; then she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself.<note>Snow White befriends a number of cute forest critters who have to show her the way to the cottage.</note> Everything in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told.<note>The cottage is very explicitly made to be dirty and dark. Snow White assumes it is the cottage of a number of mother-less children because of its miniture scale and dirtiness.</note> There was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates, and on each plate a little spoon; moreover, there were seven little knives and forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.</p>
            <p>Little Snow-White was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for she did not wish to take all from one only.<note>In leiu of this scene there is a musical number where Snow White and her animal friends clean the cottage and make dinner.</note> Then, as she was so tired, she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited her; one was too long, another too short,<note>All the beds are the same size and Snow White ends up laying across Dopey, Sneezy, and Happy's beds.</note> but at last she found that the seventh one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went to sleep.</p><pb n="325" facs="GrimmSnow325.JPG"/>
             <p>When it was quite dark the the owners of the cottage came back; they were <persName ref="Personography.xml#Seven_Dwarfs">seven dwarfs</persName> who dug and delved in the mountains for ore.<note>There is musical scene of the dwarfs closing up their mine and marching thier way home.</note> They lit their seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that someone had been there, for everything was not in the same order in which they had left it.</p>
            <p>The first said, <quote source="First_Dwarf">Who has been sitting on my chair?</quote><lb/>
               The second said, <quote source="Second_Dwarf">Who has been eating off my plate?</quote><lb/>
               The third said, <quote source="Third_Dwarf">Who has been taking some of my bread?</quote><lb/>
               The fourth said, <quote source="Fourth_Dwarf">Who has been eating my vegetables?</quote><lb/>
               The fifth said, <quote source="Fifth_Dwarf">Who has been using my fork?</quote><lb/>
               The sixth said, <quote source="Sixth_Dwarf">Who has been cutting with my knife?</quote><lb/>
               The seventh said, <quote source="Seventh_Dwarf">Who has been drinking out of my mug?</quote><lb/><note>This scene is greatly elongated with an entire comedic sceen of the dwarfs entering their cottage to face the monster that they believe has entered it.</note></p>
            <p>Then the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his bed, and he said, <quote source="First_Dwarf">Who has been getting into my bed?</quote> The others came up and each called out, <quote source="Dwarfs">Somebody has been lying in my bed too.</quote> But the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-White, who was lying asleep therein. And he called the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow-White.</p>
            <p><quote source="Dwarfs">Oh, heavens! oh, heavens!</quote> cried they, <quote source="Dwarfs">what a lovely child!</quote> and they were so glad that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed.<note>The dwarfs are very fearful of Snow-White's presence and enter the bedroom with the intent of killing the intruder. Snow White wakes up and is frightened then delighted by thier presence which is what avoides her death by pick ax.</note> And the seventh dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through the night.</p>
            <p>When it was morning little Snow-White awoke, and was frightened when she saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her name was. <quote source="Snow-White">My name is Snow-White,</quote> she answered. <note>Snow White guesses each other their names before they ask hers. They immediately recognize her as the little princess and ask her what has happened.</note> <quote source="Dwarfs">How have you come to our house?</quote> said the dwarfs. Then she told them that her step-mother had wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she has run for the whole day, until at last she had found their dwelling.</p>
            <p>The dwarfs said, <quote source="Dwarfs">If you will take care of our house, cook, make the beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat and clean, you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing.</quote><note>Snow White offers to be their houskeeper in exchange for her lodgings. This is mainly prompted by the stew she made previously beginning to boil over. Then she requires the dwarfs to act with good manners and wash up before eating. This prompts a comic scene of trying to get Grumpy to wash up for dinner.</note></p>
            <p><quote source="Snow-White">Yes,</quote> said Snow-White, <quote source="Snow-White">with all my heart,</quote> and she stayed with them. She kept the house in order for them;<note type= "interpretation">In the movie Snow White is portrayed as more of a mother figure than a dependent. She has to teach them manners and cook and clean for them. This draws upon gender roles of  the time that women and girls were mothers and homemakers, while men and boys were breadwinners and protectors. Source: Kroon</note> in the mornings they went to the mountains and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came back, and then their supper had to be ready. The girl was alone the whole day, so the good dwarfs warned her and said, <quote source="Dwarfs">Beware of your step-mother, she will soon know that you are here; be sure to let no one come in.</quote><note type= "interpretation">The dwarfs of the movie act more as comic relief than the protectors that they are supposed to be. A good amount of the hour and 23 minute run time is dedicated to their hijinks. This is also portrayed in their animation styles. Snow White, her prince, and the Evil Queen are intended to look more realistic because they are the core drama of the play whereas the dwarfs and animals are more cartoonish indicating their more comical role in the story.<lb/>Source:<lb/>Kroon</note></p><pb n="326" facs="GrimmSnow326.JPG"/>
            <p>But the Queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-White's heart, could not but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all; and she went to her looking-glass and said--</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote></p>
            <p>and the glass answered--</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,<lb/>But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,<lb/>Snow-White is still alive and well,<lb/>And none is so fair as she.</hi></quote><note>At this point, the Queen asks her question of the mirror and when she does not recieve a satisfactory answer shows the mirror the box containing the heart. The mirror once again asserts the same claim and the Queen is furious that Snow White is still alive.</note></p>
            <p>Then she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass never spoke falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little Snow-White was still alive.</p>
            <p>And so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her have no rest. And when she had at last thought of something to do, she painted her face and dressed herself like an old peddler-woman, and no one could have known her. In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">Pretty things to sell, very cheap, very cheap.</quote></p>
            <p>Little Snow-White looked out of the window and called out, <quote source="Snow-White">Good-day my good woman, what have you to sell?</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen">Good things, pretty things,</quote> she answered; <quote source="Wicked_Queen">stay-laces of all colors,</quote> she pulled out one which was woven of bright-colored silk.</p>
            <p><quote source="Snow-White">I may let the worthy old woman in,</quote> thought Snow-White, and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces.</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen">Child,</quote> said the old woman, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">what a fright you look; come, I will lace you properly for once.</quote></p>
            <p>Snow-White had no suspicion, but stood before her, and let herself be laced with the new laces. But the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that Snow-White lost her breath and fell down as if dead.</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen">Now I am the most beautiful,</quote> said the Queen to herself, and ran away.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home, but how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snow-White<pb n="327" facs="GrimmSnow327"/> lying on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to be dead. They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too tightly, they cut the laces; then she began to breathe a little, and after a while came to life again. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, <quote source="Dwarfs">The old peddler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen; take care and let no one come in when we are not with you.</quote><note type="removed_scene">This entire scene with the Queen trying to kill Snow White with overly tight bodice laces is omitted completely from the movie. This is likely do to its overly graphic nature.</note></p>
            <p>But the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the glass and asked--</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote></p>
            <p>and it answered as before--</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,<lb/>But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,<lb/>Snow-White is still alive and well,<lb/>And none is so fair as she.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>When she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she saw plainly that little Snow-White was again alive. <quote source="Wicked_Queen">But now,</quote> she said, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">I will think of something that shall put an end to you,</quote> and by the help of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb. Then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman. So she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door and cried, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!</quote> Little Snow-White looked out and said, <quote source="Snow-White">Go away; I cannot let any one come in.</quote> <quote source="Wicked_Queen">I suppose you can look,</quote> said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out and held it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled, and opened the door. When they had made a bargain the old woman said, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">Now I will comb you properly for once.</quote> Poor little Snow-White had no suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect and the girl fell down senseless. <quote source="Wicked_Queen">You paragon of beauty,</quote> said the wicked woman, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">you are done for now,</quote> and she went away.<note type= "interpretation">Aside from trying to kill her, the Wicked Queen is also extorting money from Snow-White by making her pay for the instruments of her doom.<lb/>Source:<lb/>Kroon</note></p>
            <p>But fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow-White lying as if dead upon the ground they at once suspected the step-mother, and they looked and found the<pb n="328" facs="GrimmSnow328.JPG"/> poisoned comb. Scarcely had they taken it out when Snow-White came to herself, and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be upon her guard and to open the door to no one.</p>
            <p>The Queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said--</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote></p>
            <p>then it answered as before--</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,<lb/>But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,<lb/>Snow-White is still alive and well,<lb/>And none is so fair as she.</hi></quote><note>These first two unsucessful murder plots are removed in the movie in favor of the poisoned apple.</note></p>
            <p>When she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage. <quote source="Wicked_Queen">Snow-White shall die,</quote> she cried, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">even if it costs me my life!</quote></p>
            <p>Thereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no one ever came, and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty, white with a red cheek, so that everyone who saw it longed for it; but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die. When the apple was ready she painted her face and dressed herself up as a country-woman, and so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs.<note>The Queen uses potions to first make herself into an old hag. There is a musical interlude of a party in the dwarfs cottage with much singing, dancing, and story telling. Snow White admits to her longing for the prince she met. At the end of the party the dwarfs give up all their beds to Snow White which prompts a comedic scene of each dwarf tring to find a place to sleep. The scene then shifts back to the Queen who is preparing her poisonous apple which comes with the cure of true love's first kiss. Despite this she makes the apple that has an ominous skull shape on it before becoming entirely red.</note> She knocked at the door. Snow-White put her head out of the window and said, <quote source="Snow-White">I cannot let any one in; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me.</quote> <quote source="Wicked_Queen">It is all the same to me,</quote> answered the woman, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Snow-White">No,</quote> said Snow-White, <quote source="Snow-White">I dare not take anything.</quote> <quote source="Wicked_Queen">Are you afraid of poison?</quote> said the old woman; <quote source="Wicked_Queen">look, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.</quote> The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-White longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer, and stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead.<note>Snow White is making a gooseberry pie and the disguised queen comes pretending to sell apples. She tried to convince Snow White that she should really make an apple pie. The animals sense the danger and the birds attack the Queen. Snow White brings the queen inside and offers her water. She nievely takes the apple under the persuasion that it is a magic wishing apple that will grant her wish to be reunited with her prince. She falls down dead and lightning strikes.</note> Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and laughed aloud and said, <quote source="Wicked_Queen">White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood! this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again.</quote><note type= "interpretation">There is a heavy handed religious symbolism in the Queen's death. She is struck down by a bolt of lightning indicating some sort of devine retribution for her evil ways.</note></p>
            <p>And when she asked of the looking-glass at home--</p><pb n="329" facs="GrimmSnow329.JPG"/>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote></p>
            <p>it answered at last--</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>Then her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest.<note>She does not return home, but runs away from the cottage and is then presued by the dwarfs on deerback. She runs up a mountain and tries to roll the dwarfs over with a boulder. This plan backfires, lightning strikes which breaks the ledge the Queen is standing on and she falls to her death.</note></p>
            <p>The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening,<note>The dwarfs are alerted by the forest creatures to the Queen's nefarious activity. They ride on deers back to there cottage then persue the Queen up the mountain.</note> found Snow-White lying upon the ground; she breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use; the poor child was dead, and remained dead.<note>The dwarfs do not check to ensure that she is actually dead, instead they lay her out on a person sized bed with candles and flowers. The dwarfs and the forest creatures mourn her.</note> They laid her upon a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days long.</p>
            <p>Then they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were living, and still had her pretty red cheeks. They said, <quote source="Dwarfs">We could not bury her in the dark ground,</quote> and they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides, and they laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain,<note>The coffin is in the forest near the dwarfs home.</note> and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.<note type= "interpretation">It is interesting to note that the dwarfs know the Queen is bent on killing Snow White, but all they leave her with is a stern warning. Even after two failed murder plots the dwarfs do not see it necessary to have one of them stay with her as a guard. Once she is dead, the dwarfs have a vigilant guard on her coffin. It seems that Snow White is more valueable as a possession then even as a domestic worker in their household. Despite her spike in value the dwarfs still are willing to give her away to a royal stranger.<lb/>Source:<lb/>Kroon</note> And birds came too, and wept for Snow-White; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.<note>They do not explicitly discuss putting her in a glass coffin. There is text over forest scene that changes seasons to convey that they put her in a glass coffin and to convey the passage of a great amount of time.</note></p>
            <p>And now Snow-White lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did not change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as snow, as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.</p>
            <p>It happened, however, that <persName ref="Personography.xml#Prince_Florian">a king's son</persName> came into the forest, and went to the dwarf's house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-White within it, and read what was written upon it in gold letters.<note>The prince was searching for Snow White when he heard of the sleeping maiden.</note> Then he said to the dwarfs, <quote source="Snow-White's_Prince">Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.</quote> But the dwarfs answered, <quote source="Dwarfs">We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.</quote> Then he said, <quote source="Snow-White's_Prince">Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-White. I will honor and prize her as my dearest possession.</quote> As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.<note>There was no bargining for Snow White. The dwarfs just lead the prince to her and allow him to kiss her.</note></p>
            <p>And now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump, and<pb n="330" facs="GrimmSnow330.JPG"/> with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-White had bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up and was once more alive. <quote source="Snow-White">Oh, heavens, where am I?</quote> she cried. The King's son, full of joy, said, <quote source="Snow-White's_Prince">You are with me,</quote> and told her what had happened, and said, <quote source="Snow-White">I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace, you shall be my wife.</quote><note>She just wakes up and says nothing. She is delighted to see the prince and just allows him to lift her from her coffin and place her on his horse.</note></p>
            <p>And Snow-White was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendor. But Snow-White's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the looking-glass, and said--</p>
            <p><quote source="Wicked_Queen"><hi rend="italic">Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,<lb/>Who in this land is the fairest of all?</hi></quote></p>
            <p>the glass answered--</p>
            <p><quote source="Looking-Glass"><hi rend="italic">Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest art thou,<lb/> But the young Queen is fairer by as far as I trow.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly wretched, that she knew not what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young Queen. And when she went in she knew Snow-White; and she stood still with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set before her. Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes,<note type= "interpretation">Having the Queen die by her own folly rather than at the command of Snow White or her prince removes any possibly implication of Snow White in the act which keeps the innocent image the story creates.<lb/>Sorce:<lb/>Kroon</note> and dance until she dropped down dead.<note>Snow White and her prince ride off into the sunset toward a castle.

            <head type="main">The Little Mermaid</head>
             <p>Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could sound it, and many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the <persName ref="Personography.xml#King_Triton">Sea King</persName> and his subjects.<note>The movie starts with views of the sea before following the line of a fishing net to introduce the sea loving prince who's birthday happens to be that day.</note></p>
            <p>We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed, for on this sand grow the strangest flowers and plants, the leaves and stems of which are so pliant that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and small, glide between the branches as birds fly among the trees here upon land.</p>
            <p>In the deepest spot of all stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long Gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl which would be fit for the diadem of a queen.</p>
             <p>The Sea King had been a widower for many years, and his aged mother<note type= "interpretation">In the movie, it seems that the crab conductor, <persName ref="Personography.xml#Sevastian">Sebastian</persName>, takes the place of the Grandmother as the little mermaid's guardian.</note> kept house for him.<note>There is no grandmother to keep the young princesses in check.</note> She was a very sensible woman, but exceedingly proud of her high birth, and on that account wore twelve oysters on her tail, while others of high rank were only allowed to wear six.</p>
             <p>She was, however, deserving of very great praise, especially for her care of the little sea princesses, her <persName ref="Personography.xml#Daughters_of_Triton">six granddaughters</persName>. They were beautiful children, but <persName ref="Personography.xml#Ariel">the youngest</persName> was the prettiest of them all. Her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose leaf, and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea; but, like all the others, she had no feet and her body ended in a fish's tail. All day long they played in the great halls of the castle or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls. The large amber windows were open, and the fish swam in, just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows; only the fishes swam up to the princesses, ate out of their hands, and allowed themselves to be stroked.</p>
            <p>Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden, in which grew bright-red and dark-blue flowers, and blossoms like flames of fire; the fruit glittered like gold, and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually. The earth itself was the finest sand, but blue as the flame of burning sulphur. Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance, as if the blue sky were everywhere, above and below, instead of the dark depths of the sea. In calm weather the sun could be seen, looking like a reddish-purple flower with light streaming from the calyx.</p>
            <p>Each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden, where she might dig and plant as she pleased. One arranged her flower bed in the form of a whale; another preferred to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid; while the youngest child made hers round, like the sun, and in it grew flowers as red as his rays at sunset.<note>The next scene shows merfolk going to the castle for a concert conducted by a crab named Sebastian where Ariel is to be the featured singer. When she is supposed to sing, it is revealed that Ariel is not there.</note></p>
             <p>She was a strange child, quiet and thoughtful. While her sisters showed delight at the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels, she cared only for her pretty flowers,<note>Ariel is very preoccupied with treasures from ships so much so that she has an entire cave devoted to them.</note> red like the sun, and a beautiful marble statue. It was the representation of a handsome boy, carved out of pure white stone, which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck.</p><note>Ariel is first seen scavanging through shipwrecks with her fish friend <persName ref="Personography.xml#Flounder">Flounder</persName>. They are then persued by a shark before out witting him and going to the surface to learn about the different objects she has found from a seagull.</note>
            <p>She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow. It grew rapidly and soon hung its fresh branches over the statue, almost down to the blue sands. The shadows had the color of violet and waved to and fro like the branches, so that it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play, trying to kiss each other.</p>
            <p>Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea. She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns, the people and the animals. To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land had fragrance, while those below the sea had none; that the trees of the forest were green; and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly that it was a pleasure to listen to them. Her grandmother called the birds fishes, or the little mermaid would not have understood what was meant, for she had never seen birds.</p>
            <p><quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">When you have reached your fifteenth year,</quote> said the grandmother, <quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">you will have permission to rise up out of the sea and sit on the rocks in the moonlight, while the great ships go sailing by. Then you will see both forests and towns.</quote><note>There is not particular time set to be allowed to go to the surface, just that King Triton believes it to be too dangerous for his daughters.</note></p>
            <p>In the following year, one of the sisters would be fifteen, but as each was a year younger than the other, the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean to see the earth as we do. However, each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit and what she thought was most beautiful. Their grandmother could not tell them enough—there were so many things about which they wanted to know.</p>
            <p>None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest—she who had the longest time to wait and who was so quiet and thoughtful. Many nights she stood by the open window, looking up through the dark blue water and watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails. She could see the moon and stars shining faintly, but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes. When something like a black cloud passed between her and them, she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head, or a ship full of human beings who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them, holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship.</p>
            <p>At length the eldest was fifteen and was allowed to rise to the surface of the ocean.</p>
            <p>When she returned she had hundreds of things to talk about. But the finest thing, she said, was to lie on a sand bank in the quiet moonlit sea, near the shore, gazing at the lights of the near-by town, that twinkled like hundreds of stars, and listening to the sounds of music, the noise of carriages, the voices of human beings, and the merry pealing of the bells in the church steeples. Because she could not go near all these wonderful things, she longed for them all the more.</p>
            <p>Oh, how eagerly did the youngest sister listen to all these descriptions! And afterwards, when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark-blue water, she thought of the great city, with all its bustle and noise, and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells down in the depths of the sea.</p>
            <p>In another year the second sister received permission to rise to the surface of the water and to swim about where she pleased. She rose just as the sun was setting, and this, she said, was the most beautiful sight of all. The whole sky looked like gold, and violet and rose-colored clouds, which she could not describe, drifted across it. And more swiftly than the clouds, flew a large flock of wild swans toward the setting sun, like a long white veil across the sea. She also swam towards the sun, but it sank into the waves, and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea.</p>
            <p>The third sister's turn followed, and she was the boldest of them all, for she swam up a broad river that emptied into the sea. On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines, and palaces and castles peeping out from amid the proud trees of the forest. She heard birds singing and felt the rays of the sun so strongly that she was obliged often to dive under the water to cool her burning face. In a narrow creek she found a large group of little human children, almost naked, sporting about in the water. She wanted to play with them, but they fled in a great fright; and then a little black animal—it was a dog, but she did not know it, for she had never seen one before—came to the water and barked at her so furiously that she became frightened and rushed back to the open sea. But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest, the green hills, and the pretty children who could swim in the water although they had no tails.</p>
            <p>The fourth sister was more timid. She remained in the midst of the sea, but said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land. She could see many miles around her, and the sky above looked like a bell of glass. She had seen the ships, but at such a great distance that they looked like sea gulls. The dolphins sported in the waves, and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction.</p>
            <p>The fifth sister's birthday occurred in the winter, so when her turn came she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up. The sea looked quite green, and large icebergs were floating about, each like a pearl, she said, but larger and loftier than the churches built by men. They were of the most singular shapes and glittered like diamonds. She had seated herself on one of the largest and let the wind play with her long hair. She noticed that all the ships sailed past very rapidly, steering as far away as they could, as if they were afraid of the iceberg. Towards evening, as the sun went down, dark clouds covered the sky, the thunder rolled, and the flashes of lightning glowed red on the icebergs as they were tossed about by the heaving sea. On all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling, while she sat on the floating iceberg, calmly watching the lightning as it darted its forked flashes into the sea.</p>
            <p>Each of the sisters, when first she had permission to rise to the surface, was delighted with the new and beautiful sights. Now that they were grown-up girls and could go when they pleased, they had become quite indifferent about it. They soon wished themselves back again, and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below and pleasanter to be at home.<note>Sebastian is charged with watching Ariel after she is reprimanded for missing the concert in favor of learning about the human world. Ariel keeps a secret cavern of items from the surface and sings about how she not only wants to see the surface, but to meet the people. At the end of this song she notices fireworks which prompt her to rise to the surface.</note></p>
            <p>Yet often, in the evening hours, the five sisters would twine their arms about each other and rise to the surface together. Their voices were more charming than that of any human being, and before the approach of a storm, when they feared that a ship might be lost, they swam before the vessel, singing enchanting songs of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea and begging the voyagers not to fear if they sank to the bottom. But the sailors could not understand the song and thought it was the sighing of the storm. These things were never beautiful to them, for if the ship sank, the men were drowned and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King.</p>
            <p>When the sisters rose, arm in arm, through the water, their youngest sister would stand quite alone, looking after them, ready to cry—only, since mermaids have no tears, she suffered more acutely.</p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">Oh, were I but fifteen years old!</quote> said she. <quote source="Little_Mermaid">I know that I shall love the world up there, and all the people who live in it.</quote><note>None of these past adventure of the sisters are recounted.</note></p>
            <p>At last she reached her fifteenth year.<note>It is explicitedly stated that Ariel is 16.</note></p>
            <p><quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">Well, now you are grown up,</quote> said the old dowager, her grandmother. <quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">Come, and let me adorn you like your sisters.</quote> And she placed in her hair a wreath of white lilies, of which every flower leaf was half a pearl. Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank.</p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">But they hurt me so,</quote> said the little mermaid.</p>
            <p><quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">Yes, I know; pride must suffer pain,</quote> replied the old lady.</p>
            <p>Oh, how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur and laid aside the heavy wreath! The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better. But she could not change herself, so she said farewell and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water.</p>
            <p>The sun had just set when she raised her head above the waves. The clouds were tinted with crimson and gold, and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty. The sea was calm, and the air mild and fresh. A large ship with three masts lay becalmed on the water; only one sail was set, for not a breeze stirred, and the sailors sat idle on deck or amidst the rigging. There was music and song on board, and as darkness came on, a hundred colored lanterns were lighted, as if the flags of all nations waved in the air.</p>
            <p>The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows, and now and then, as the waves lifted her up, she could look in through glass window-panes and see a number of gayly dressed people.</p>
             <p>Among them, and the most beautiful of all, was a <persName ref="Personography.xml#Prince_Eric">young prince</persName> with large, black eyes. He was sixteen years of age, and his birthday was being celebrated with great display. The sailors were dancing on deck, and when the prince came out of the cabin, more than a hundred rockets rose in the air, making it as bright as day. The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water, and when she again stretched out her head, it looked as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her.</p>
            <p>She had never seen such fireworks before. Great suns spurted fire about, splendid fireflies flew into the blue air, and everything was reflected in the clear, calm sea beneath. The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people, and even the smallest rope, could be distinctly seen. How handsome the young prince looked, as he pressed the hands of all his guests and smiled at them, while the music resounded through the clear night air!</p>
            <p>It was very late, yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship or from the beautiful prince.<note>Ariel comes to find the ship where Prince Eric is indeed celebrating his birthday and at which point he recieves a statue of himself as a gift.</note> The colored lanterns had been extinguished, no more rockets rose in the air, and the cannon had ceased firing; but the sea became restless, and a moaning, grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves. Still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window, rocking up and down on the water, so that she could look within. After a while the sails were quickly set, and the ship went on her way. But soon the waves rose higher, heavy clouds darkened the sky, and lightning appeared in the distance. A dreadful storm was approaching. Once more the sails were furled, and the great ship pursued her flying course over the raging sea. The waves rose mountain high, as if they would overtop the mast, but the ship dived like a swan between them, then rose again on their lofty, foaming crests. To the little mermaid this was pleasant sport; but not so to the sailors. At length the ship groaned and creaked; the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea, as the waves broke over the deck; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed, and as the ship lay over on her side, the water rushed in.</p>
            <p>The little mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger; even she was obliged to be careful, to avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the water. At one moment it was pitch dark so that she could not see a single object, but when a flash of lightning came it revealed the whole scene; she could see every one who had been on board except the prince. When the ship parted, she had seen him sink into the deep waves, and she was glad, for she thought he would now be with her. Then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water, so that when he got down to her father's palace he would certainly be quite dead.</p>
            <p>No, he must not die! So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea, forgetting that they could crush her to pieces. Diving deep under the dark waters, rising and falling with the waves, she at length managed to reach the young prince, who was fast losing the power to swim in that stormy sea. His limbs were failing him, his beautiful eyes were closed, and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his assistance. She held his head above the water and let the waves carry them where they would.</p>
            <p>In the morning the storm had ceased, but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen. The sun came up red and shining out of the water, and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince's cheeks, but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed his high, smooth forehead and stroked back his wet hair. He seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden, so she kissed him again and wished that he might live.</p>
            <p>Presently they came in sight of land, and she saw lofty blue mountains on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them. Beautiful green forests were near the shore, and close by stood a large building, whether a church or a convent she could not tell. Orange and citron trees grew in the garden, and before the door stood lofty palms. The sea here formed a little bay, in which the water lay quiet and still, but very deep. She swam with the handsome prince to the beach, which was covered with fine white sand, and there she laid him in the warm sunshine, taking care to raise his head higher than his body. Then bells sounded in the large white building, and some young girls came into the garden. The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and hid herself among some high rocks that rose out of the water. Covering her head and neck with the foam of the sea, she watched there to see what would become of the poor prince.<note>A storm does wreck the ship and Ariel saves her prince. He is, however, not found on the beach by little girls. He knows his savior by her voice.</note></p>
            <p>It was not long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where the prince lay. She seemed frightened at first, but only for a moment; then she brought a number of people, and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again and smiled upon those who stood about him. But to her he sent no smile; he knew not that she had saved him. This made her very sorrowful, and when he was led away into the great building, she dived down into the water and returned to her father's castle.</p>
            <p>She had always been silent and thoughtful, and now she was more so than ever. Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water, but she could tell them nothing. Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince. She saw the fruits in the garden ripen and watched them gathered; she watched the snow on the mountain tops melt away; but never did she see the prince, and therefore she always returned home more sorrowful than before.</p>
            <p>It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden and fling her arm around the beautiful marble statue, which was like the prince. She gave up tending her flowers, and they grew in wild confusion over the paths, twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees so that the whole place became dark and gloomy.</p>
            <p>At length she could bear it no longer and told one of her sisters all about it. Then the others heard the secret, and very soon it became known to several mermaids, one of whom had an intimate friend who happened to know about the prince. She had also seen the festival on board ship, and she told them where the prince came from and where his palace stood.</p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid_Princesses">Come, little sister,</quote> said the other princesses. Then they entwined their arms and rose together to the surface of the water, near the spot where they knew the prince's palace stood. It was built of bright-yellow, shining stone and had long flights of marble steps, one of which reached quite down to the sea. Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof, and between the pillars that surrounded the whole building stood lifelike statues of marble. Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms, with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry and walls covered with beautiful paintings. In the center of the largest salon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling, through which the sun shone in upon the water and upon the beautiful plants that grew in the basin of the fountain.</p>
            <p>Now that the little mermaid knew where the prince lived, she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace. She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others had ventured, and once she went up the narrow channel under the marble balcony, which threw a broad shadow on the water. Here she sat and watched the young prince, who thought himself alone in the bright moonlight.</p>
            <p>She often saw him evenings, sailing in a beautiful boat on which music sounded and flags waved. She peeped out from among the green rushes, and if the wind caught her long silvery-white veil, those who saw it believed it to be a swan, spreading out its wings.</p>
            <p>Many a night, too, when the fishermen set their nets by the light of their torches, she heard them relate many good things about the young prince. And this made her glad that she had saved his life when he was tossed about half dead on the waves. She remembered how his head had rested on her bosom and how heartily she had kissed him, but he knew nothing of all this and could not even dream of her.</p>
            <p>She grew more and more to like human beings and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own. They could fly over the sea in ships and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds; and the lands they possessed, their woods and their fields, stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight. There was so much that she wished to know! but her sisters were unable to answer all her questions. She then went to her old grandmother, who knew all about the upper world, which she rightly called "the lands above the sea."</p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">If human beings are not drowned,</quote> asked the little mermaid, <quote source="Little_Mermaid">can they live forever? Do they never die, as we do here in the sea?</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">Yes,</quote> replied the old lady, <quote source="Grandmotehr_Mermaid">they must also die, and their term of life is even shorter than ours. We sometimes live for three hundred years, but when we cease to exist here, we become only foam on the surface of the water and have not even a grave among those we love. We have not immortal souls, we shall never live again; like the green seaweed when once it has been cut off, we can never flourish more. Human beings, on the contrary, have souls which live forever, even after the body has been turned to dust. They rise up through the clear, pure air, beyond the glittering stars. As we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth, so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">Why have not we immortal souls?</quote> asked the little mermaid, mournfully. <quote source="Little_Mermaid">I would gladly give all the hundreds of years that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">You must not think that,</quote> said the old woman. <quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">We believe that we are much happier and much better off than human beings.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">So I shall die,</quote> said the little mermaid, <quote source="Little_Mermaid">and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about, never again to hear the music of the waves or to see the pretty flowers or the red sun? Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul?</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">No,</quote> said the old woman; <quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">unless a man should love you so much that you were more to him than his father or his mother, and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you, and the priest placed his right hand in yours, and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter—then his soul would glide into your body, and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind. He would give to you a soul and retain his own as well; but this can never happen. Your fish's tail, which among us is considered so beautiful, on earth is thought to be quite ugly. They do not know any better, and they think it necessary, in order to be handsome, to have two stout props, which they call legs.</quote></p>
            <p>Then the little mermaid sighed and looked sorrowfully at her fish's tail. <quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">Let us be happy,</quote> said the old lady, <quote source="Grandmother_Mermaid">and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live, which is really quite long enough. After that we can rest ourselves all the better. This evening we are going to have a court ball.</quote><note>Most of the scenes between the sisters and discussion of imortal souls. After saving her prince Ariel is very lovestruck. Sebastian tries to dissuade her from wanting to go to the human world through a song. Flounder show Ariel the statue that fell off the prince's ship. Sebastian tells her father that she is in love with a human. King Triton finds Ariel's cave of human things and destroys it.</note></p>
            <p>It was one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth. The walls and the ceiling of the large ballroom were of thick but transparent crystal. Many hundreds of colossal shells,—some of a deep red, others of a grass green,—with blue fire in them, stood in rows on each side. These lighted up the whole salon, and shone through the walls so that the sea was also illuminated. Innumerable fishes, great and small, swam past the crystal walls; on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliance, and on others shone like silver and gold. Through the halls flowed a broad stream, and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing.</p>
            <p>No one on earth has such lovely voices as they, but the little mermaid sang more sweetly than all. The whole court applauded her with hands and tails, and for a moment her heart felt quite gay, for she knew she had the sweetest voice either on earth or in the sea. But soon she thought again of the world above her; she could not forget the charming prince, nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his. She crept away silently out of her father's palace, and while everything within was gladness and song, she sat in her own little garden, sorrowful and alone. Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water and thought: <quote source="Little_Mermaid">He is certainly sailing above, he in whom my wishes center and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life. I will venture all for him and to win an immortal soul. While my sisters are dancing in my father's palace I will go to the sea witch<note>The sea witch is given the name Ursula and is portrayed thusly in the 1989 movie. <figure><graphic url="LittleMermaid_Ursula.jpg"></graphic></figure><lb/>Source:<lb/>Disney,<hi rend="italic">The Little Mermaid</hi>, 1989</note>,<note>Ariel does not think to visit the sea witch until she is prompted to do so by Ursula's minions. There is an underlying plot of overthrowing King Triton mixed in with Ursula's helpfulness.</note> of whom I have always been so much afraid; she can give me counsel and help.</quote></p>
            <p>Then the little mermaid went out from her garden and took the road to the foaming whirlpools, behind which the sorceress lived. She had never been that way before. Neither flowers nor grass grew there; nothing but bare, gray, sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool, where the water, like foaming mill wheels, seized everything that came within its reach and cast it into the fathomless deep. Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass before she could reach the dominions of the sea witch. Then, for a long distance, the road lay across a stretch of warm, bubbling mire, called by the witch her turf moor.</p>
            <p>Beyond this was the witch's house, which stood in the center of a strange forest, where all the trees and flowers were polypi, half animals and half plants. They looked like serpents with a hundred heads, growing out of the ground. The branches were long, slimy arms, with fingers like flexible worms, moving limb after limb from the root to the top. All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon and held fast, so that it never escaped from their clutches.</p>
            <p>The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw that she stood still and her heart beat with fear. She came very near turning back, but she thought of the prince and of the human soul for which she longed, and her courage returned. She fastened her long, flowing hair round her head, so that the polypi should not lay hold of it. She crossed her hands on her bosom, and then darted forward as a fish shoots through the water, between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi, which were stretched out on each side of her. She saw that they all held in their grasp something they had seized with their numerous little arms, which were as strong as iron bands. Tightly grasped in their clinging arms were white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea and had sunk down into the deep waters; skeletons of land animals; and oars, rudders, and chests, of ships. There was even a little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled, and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess.</p>
            <p>She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood, where large, fat water snakes were rolling in the mire and showing their ugly, drab-colored bodies. In the midst of this spot stood a house, built of the bones of shipwrecked human beings. There sat the sea witch, allowing a toad to eat from her mouth just as people sometimes feed a canary with pieces of sugar. She called the ugly water snakes her little chickens and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom.</p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">I know what you want,</quote> said the sea witch. <quote source="Sea_Witch">It is very stupid of you, but you shall have your way, though it will bring you to sorrow, my pretty princess. You want to get rid of your fish's tail and to have two supports instead, like human beings on earth, so that the young prince may fall in love with you and so that you may have an immortal soul.</quote> And then the witch laughed so loud and so disgustingly that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground and lay there wriggling.</p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">You are but just in time,</quote> said the witch, <quote source="Sea_Witch">for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year. I will prepare a draft for you, with which you must swim to land to-morrow before sunrise; seat yourself there and drink it. Your tail will then disappear, and shrink up into what men call legs.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">You will feel great pain, as if a sword were passing through you. But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw. You will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement, and no dancer will ever tread so lightly. Every step you take, however, will be as if you were treading upon sharp knives and as if the blood must flow. If you will bear all this, I will help you.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">Yes, I will,</quote> said the little princess in a trembling voice, as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul.</p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">But think again,</quote> said the witch, <quote source="Sea_Witch">for when once your shape has become like a human being, you can no more be a mermaid. You will never return through the water to your sisters or to your father's palace again. And if you do not win the love of the prince, so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake and to love you with his whole soul and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife, then you will never have an immortal soul. The first morning after he marries another, your heart will break and you will become foam on the crest of the waves.</quote><note>The ultimatum is a little different here. Ursula gives Ariel just three days for a kiss of true love. There is also no mentioned pain with the transformation.</note></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">I will do it,</quote> said the little mermaid, and she became pale as death.</p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">But I must be paid, also,</quote> said the witch, <quote source="Sea_Witch">and it is not a trifle that I ask. You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea, and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it. But this voice you must give to me. The best thing you possess will I have as the price of my costly draft, which must be mixed with my own blood so that it may be as sharp as a two-edged sword.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">But if you take away my voice,</quote> said the little mermaid, <quote source="Little_Mermaid">what is left for me?</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">Your beautiful form, your graceful walk, and your expressive eyes. Surely with these you can enchain a man's heart. Well, have you lost your courage? Put out your little tongue, that I may cut it off as my payment; then you shall have the powerful draft.</quote><note>Rather than cut out her tongue, Ursula opts for the more humane magic spell that seals voice.</note></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">It shall be,</quote> said the little mermaid.</p>
            <p>Then the witch placed her caldron on the fire, to prepare the magic draft.</p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">Cleanliness is a good thing,</quote> said she, scouring the vessel with snakes which she had tied together in a large knot. Then she pricked herself in the breast and let the black blood drop into the caldron. The steam that rose twisted itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear. Every moment the witch threw a new ingredient into the vessel, and when it began to boil, the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile. When at last the magic draft was ready, it looked like the clearest water.</p>
            <p><quote source="Sea_Witch">There it is for you,</quote> said the witch. Then she cut off the mermaid's tongue, so that she would never again speak or sing. <quote source="Sea_Witch">If the polypi should seize you as you return through the wood,</quote> said the witch, <quote source="Sea_Witch">throw over them a few drops of the potion, and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces.</quote> But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this, for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draft, which shone in her hand like a twinkling star.</p>
            <p>So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh and between the rushing whirlpools. She saw that in her father's palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished and that all within were asleep. But she did not venture to go in to them, for now that she was dumb and going to leave them forever she felt as if her heart would break. She stole into the garden, took a flower from the flower bed of each of her sisters, kissed her hand towards the palace a thousand times, and then rose up through the dark-blue waters.</p>
            <p>The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace and approached the beautiful marble steps, but the moon shone clear and bright. Then the little mermaid drank the magic draft, and it seemed as if a two-edged sword went through her delicate body. She fell into a swoon and lay like one dead. When the sun rose and shone over the sea, she recovered and felt a sharp pain, but before her stood the handsome young prince.</p>
            <p>He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own and then became aware that her fish's tail was gone and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have. But she had no clothes, so she wrapped herself in her long, thick hair.<note>After obtaining legs from Ursula, Ariel finds herself on the same beach where she left Prince Eric. Her bird friend Scuttle helps her dress in a torn sail before Eric's dog then Eric himself find her.</note> The prince asked her who she was and whence she came. She looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes, but could not speak. He took her by the hand and led her to the palace.</p>
            <p>Before her stood the handsome young prince....</p>
            <p>Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be; she felt as if she were treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives. She bore it willingly, however, and moved at the prince's side as lightly as a bubble, so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful, swaying movements. She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin and was the most beautiful creature in the palace; but she was dumb and could neither speak nor sing.</p>
            <p>Beautiful female slaves, dressed in silk and gold, stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents. One sang better than all the others, and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her. This was a great sorrow to the little mermaid, for she knew how much more sweetly she herself once could sing, and she thought, <quote source="Little_Mermaid">Oh, if he could only know that I have given away my voice forever, to be with him!</quote></p>
            <p>The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances, to the sound of beautiful music. Then the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms, stood on the tips of her toes, glided over the floor, and danced as no one yet had been able to dance. At each moment her beauty was more revealed, and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves. Every one was enchanted, especially the prince, who called her his little foundling. She danced again quite readily, to please him, though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives.</p>
            <p>The prince said she should remain with him always, and she was given permission to sleep at his door, on a velvet cushion. He had a page's dress made for her, that she might accompany him on horseback. They rode together through the sweet-scented woods, where the green boughs touched their shoulders, and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves. She climbed with him to the tops of high mountains, and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked, she only smiled, and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them like a flock of birds flying to distant lands. While at the prince's palace, and when all the household were asleep, she would go and sit on the broad marble steps, for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea water. It was then that she thought of all those below in the deep.</p>
            <p>Once during the night her sisters came up arm in arm, singing sorrowfully as they floated on the water. She beckoned to them, and they recognized her and told her how she had grieved them; after that, they came to the same place every night. Once she saw in the distance her old grandmother, who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years, and the old Sea King, her father, with his crown on his head. They stretched out their hands towards her, but did not venture so near the land as her sisters had.</p>
            <p>As the days passed she loved the prince more dearly, and he loved her as one would love a little child. The thought never came to him to make her his wife. Yet unless he married her, she could not receive an immortal soul, and on the morning after his marriage with another, she would dissolve into the foam of the sea.</p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">Do you not love me the best of them all?</quote> the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her fair forehead.</p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">Yes, you are dear to me,</quote> said the prince, <quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">for you have the best heart and you are the most devoted to me. You are like a young maiden whom I once saw, but whom I shall never meet again. I was in a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple where several young maidens performed the service. The youngest of them found me on the shore and saved my life. I saw her but twice, and she is the only one in the world whom I could love. But you are like her, and you have almost driven her image from my mind. She belongs to the holy temple, and good fortune has sent you to me in her stead. We will never part.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Little_Mermaid">Ah, he knows not that it was I who saved his life,</quote> thought the little mermaid. <quote source="Little_Mermaid">I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands; I sat beneath the foam and watched till the human beings came to help him. I saw the pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves me.</quote> The mermaid sighed deeply, but she could not weep. <quote source="Little_Mermaid">He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple, therefore she will never return to the world—they will meet no more. I am by his side and see him every day. I will take care of him, and love him, and give up my life for his sake.</quote></p>
            <p>Very soon it was said that the prince was to marry and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife, for a fine ship was being fitted out. Although the prince gave out that he intended merely to pay a visit to the king, it was generally supposed that he went to court the princess. A great company were to go with him. The little mermaid smiled and shook her head. She knew the prince's thoughts better than any of the others.</p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">I must travel,</quote> he had said to her; <quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">I must see this beautiful princess. My parents desire it, but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride. I cannot love her, because she is not like the beautiful maiden in the temple, whom you resemble. If I were forced to choose a bride, I would choose you, my dumb foundling, with those expressive eyes.</quote> Then he kissed her rosy mouth, played with her long, waving hair, and laid his head on her heart, while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul.<note>Sebastian has an eventful time trying to get to Ariel at dinner. The next day Eric takes her on a tour of the town until they find themselves on a romantic boat ride where he nearly kisses Ariel.</note></p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">You are not afraid of the sea, my dumb child, are you?</quote> he said, as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king. Then he told her of storm and of calm, of strange fishes in the deep beneath them, and of what the divers had seen there. She smiled at his descriptions, for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea.</p>
            <p>In the moonlight night, when all on board were asleep except the man at the helm, she sat on deck, gazing down through the clear water. She thought she could distinguish her father's castle, and upon it her aged grandmother, with the silver crown on her head, looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel. Then her sisters came up on the waves and gazed at her mournfully, wringing their white hands. She beckoned to them, and smiled, and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was. But the cabin boy approached, and when her sisters dived down, he thought what he saw was only the foam of the sea.</p>
            <p>The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit. The church bells were ringing, and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets. Soldiers, with flying colors and glittering bayonets, lined the roads through which they passed. Every day was a festival, balls and entertainments following one another. But the princess had not yet appeared. People said that she had been brought up and educated in a religious house, where she was learning every royal virtue.</p>
            <p>At last she came. Then the little mermaid, who was anxious to see whether she was really beautiful, was obliged to admit that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty. Her skin was delicately fair, and beneath her long, dark eyelashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity.<note>The other princess, Vanessa, who has the voice of Eric's savior is none other than Ursula. Ariel swims out to the wedding barge to try and stop it.</note></p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">It was you,</quote> said the prince, <quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">who saved my life when I lay as if dead on the beach,</quote> and he folded his blushing bride in his arms.</p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">Oh, I am too happy!</quote> said he to the little mermaid; <quote source="Mermaid's_Prince">my fondest hopes are now fulfilled. You will rejoice at my happiness, for your devotion to me is great and sincere.</quote></p>
            <p>The little mermaid kissed his hand and felt as if her heart were already broken. His wedding morning would bring death to her, and she would change into the foam of the sea.</p>
            <p>All the church bells rang, and the heralds rode through the town proclaiming the betrothal. Perfumed oil was burned in costly silver lamps on every altar. The priests waved the censers, while the bride and the bridegroom joined their hands and received the blessing of the bishop. The little mermaid, dressed in silk and gold, held up the bride's train; but her ears heard nothing of the festive music, and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony. She thought of the night of death which was coming to her, and of all she had lost in the world.</p>
            <p>On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board the ship. Cannons were roaring, flags waving, and in the center of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected. It contained elegant sleeping couches for the bridal pair during the night. The ship, under a favorable wind, with swelling sails, glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea.</p>
            <p>When it grew dark, a number of colored lamps were lighted and the sailors danced merrily on the deck. The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea, when she had seen similar joyful festivities, so she too joined in the dance, poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey, and all present cheered her wonderingly. She had never danced so gracefully before. Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives, but she cared not for the pain; a sharper pang had pierced her heart.</p>
            <p>She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home. She had given up her beautiful voice and suffered unheard-of pain daily for him, while he knew nothing of it. This was the last evening that she should breathe the same air with him or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea. An eternal night, without a thought or a dream, awaited her. She had no soul, and now could never win one.</p>
            <p>All was joy and gaiety on the ship until long after midnight. She smiled and danced with the rest, while the thought of death was in her heart. The prince kissed his beautiful bride and she played with his raven hair till they went arm in arm to rest in the sumptuous tent. Then all became still on board the ship, and only the pilot, who stood at the helm, was awake. The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning—for that first ray of the dawn which was to be her death. She saw her sisters rising out of the flood. They were as pale as she, but their beautiful hair no longer waved in the wind; it had been cut off.</p>
            <p><quote source="Mermaid_Princesses">We have given our hair to the witch,</quote> said they, <quote source="Mermaid_Princesses">to obtain help for you, that you may not die to-night. She has given us a knife; see, it is very sharp. Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince. When the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again into a fish's tail, and you will once more be a mermaid and can return to us to live out your three hundred years before you are changed into the salt sea foam. Haste, then; either he or you must die before sunrise. Our old grandmother mourns so for you that her white hair is falling, as ours fell under the witch's scissors. Kill the prince, and come back. Hasten! Do you not see the first red streaks in the sky? In a few minutes the sun will rise, and you must die.</quote></p>
            <p>Then they sighed deeply and mournfully, and sank beneath the waves.</p>
            <p>The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent and beheld the fair bride, whose head was resting on the prince's breast. She bent down and kissed his noble brow, then looked at the sky, on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter. She glanced at the sharp knife and again fixed her eyes on the prince, who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams.</p>
            <p>She was in his thoughts, and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid—but she flung it far from her into the waves. The water turned red where it fell, and the drops that spurted up looked like blood. She cast one more lingering, half-fainting glance at the prince, then threw herself from the ship into the sea and felt her body dissolving into foam.<note>The wedding does not happen and Ariel does not resign herself to die. King Triton bargins away his power to save his daughter who has returned to her mermaid form but is now a thrall of Ursula. Ursula then becomes a monster who creates a whirlpool. She is finally stopped when Eric rams the broken mast of a dredged up ship into the sea witch's stomach.</note></p>
            <p>The sun rose above the waves, and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid, who did not feel as if she were dying. She saw the bright sun, and hundreds of transparent, beautiful creatures floating around her—she could see through them the white sails of the ships and the red clouds in the sky. Their speech was melodious, but could not be heard by mortal ears—just as their bodies could not be seen by mortal eyes. The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam. <quote source="Little_Mermaid">Where am I?</quote> asked she, and her voice sounded ethereal, like the voices of those who were with her. No earthly music could imitate it.</p>
            <p><quote source="Daughter_of_the_Air">Among the daughters of the air,</quote> answered one of them. <quote source="Daughter_of_the_Air">A mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being. On the will of another hangs her eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves. We fly to warm countries and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and restoration.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Daughter_of_the_Air">After we have striven for three hundred years to do all the good in our power, we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing. You have suffered and endured, and raised yourself to the spirit world by your good deeds, and now, by striving for three hundred years in the same way, you may obtain an immortal soul.</quote></p>
            <p>The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes toward the sun and, for the first time, felt them filling with tears.</p>
            <p>On the ship in which she had left the prince there were life and noise, and she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her. Sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of the bride and fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated above.</p>
            <p><quote source="Daughter_of_the_Air">After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven,</quote> said she. <quote source="Daughter_of_the Air">And we may even get there sooner,</quote> whispered one of her companions. <quote source="Daughter_of_the_Air">Unseen we can enter the houses of men where there are children, and for every day on which we find a good child that is the joy of his parents and deserves their love, our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, when we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good conduct—for we can count one year less of our three hundred years. But when we see a naughty or a wicked child we shed tears of sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial.</quote><note>King Triton relents when he sees how much his daughter loves the human. The two are married and live happily together.</note></p>

            <pb n="84" facs="GrimmRapunzel84.JPG"/><head type="main">Rapunzel</head>  
             <p>There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.<note>A king and a queen who were with child until the queen became ill.</note> At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an <persName ref="Personography.xml#Mother_Gothel">enchantress</persName>, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and looked pale and miserable.</p>
            <p>Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, <quote source="Rapunzel's_Father">What aileth thee, dear wife?</quote> <quote source="Rapunzel's_Mother">Ah,</quote> she replied, <quote source="Rapunzel's_Mother">if I can't get some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, to eat, I shall die.</quote> The man, who loved her, thought, <quote source="Rapunzel's_Father">Sooner than let thy wife die, bring her some of the rampion thyself, let it cost thee what it will.</quote></p><pb n="85" facs="GrimmRapunzel85.JPG"/>
            <p>In the twilight of the evening, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife.<note>Rather than rampion, the kingdom searches for a magic sun flower to cure the queen. This flower is hoarded by an old witch who uses it to keep herself young.</note> She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it with much relish. She, however, liked it so much -- so very much, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him. <quote source="Enchantress">How canst thou dare,</quote> said she with angry look, <quote source="Enchantress">to descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief? Thou shalt suffer for it!</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Rapunzel's_Father">Ah,</quote> answered he, <quote source="Rapunzel's_Father">let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat.</quote></p>
            <p>Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, <quote source="Enchantress">If the case be as thou sayest, I will allow thee to take away with thee as much rampion as thou wilt, only I make one condition, thou must give me the child which thy wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother.</quote></p>
             <p>The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of <persName ref="Personography.xml#Rapunzel">Rapunzel</persName>, and took it away with her.<note>The witch takes the child because the magical properties of the flower were transfered to the princess's hair.</note></p>
            <p>Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.<note>Rapunzel grows up in her tower spending most of her time doing various artistic activities. Mother Gothel returns to the tower and Rapunzel implores her to go see the floating lights for her 18th birthday. Gothel will not allow it and scares Rapunzel into staying in the tower.</note> When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,</p>
            <p><quote source="Enchantress"><hi rend="italic">Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<lb/> Let down thy hair to me.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells<note>Twenty ells is approximately 38 ft. In the Disney cannon her hair is 70 ft long.</note> down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.</p>
             <p>After a year or two, it came to pass that the King's son rode through the forest and went by the tower.<note><persName ref="Personography.xml#Flynn_Rider">Flynn Rider</persName> and his associates steal at royal crown. While being persued by the royal guard, Rider takes refuge in Rapunzel's tower where she then takes him hostage. She considers telling her mother of this feat, but is dissuaded by Gothel's anger. When Gothel leaves to find a more suitable birthday present, Rapunzel interrogates Rider. She makes a deal with him to see the lanterns in exchange for the crown.</note> Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her<pb n="86" facs="GrimmRapunzel86.JPG"/> solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The King's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but there was none to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,</p>
            <p><quote source="Enchantress"><hi rend="italic">Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<lb/> Let down thy hair to me.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. <quote source="Rapunzel's_Prince">If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will for once try my fortune,</quote> said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,</p>
            <p><quote source="Rapunzel's_Prince"><hi rend="italic">Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<lb/> Let down thy hair to me.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>Immediately the hair fell down and the King's son climbed up.</p>
            <p>At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her; but the King's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, <quote source="Rapunzel">He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does</quote>; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his. She said, <quote source="Rapunzel">I will willingly go away with thee, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with thee a skein of silk every time that thou comest, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and thou wilt take me on thy horse.</quote><note>Rapunzel leaves her tower by sliding down her own hair. She and Rider go to a tavern where they meet kindly thugs, but are soon once again persued by the royal guard. After escaping mortal peril and all their pursuants the pair befriend the royal guard horse Maximus. The group finally enters the town while a festival for the lost princess is taking place. After a day of fun the two wait in a boat to see the lanterns in the sky.</note></p>
            <p>They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by the day.<note>Rider decides Rapunzel is more important to him than any treasure so he tries to settle his debts. He is double crossed then his associates are also double crossed. Rapunzel, heart broken, returns with Gothel.</note> The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said to her, <quote source="Rapunzel">Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young King's son-- he is with me in a moment.</quote></p>
            <p><quote source="Enchantress">Ah! thou wicked child,</quote> cried the enchantress <quote source="Enchantress">What do I hear thee say! I thought I had separated thee from all the world, and yet thou hast decieved me!</quote><note>After escaping incarceration Rider goes back to the tower to save Rapunzel. Rapunzel has come to the realization that she is in fact the lost princess and confronts Gothel about this fact. Gothel tries to take Rapunzel away so that no one will steal her precious fountain of youth. She even goes so far as to stab Rider.</note></p><pb n="87" facs="GrimmRapunzel87.JPG"/>
            <p>In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, siezed a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.</p>
            <p>On the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the enchantress in the evening fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off to the hook of the window, and when the King's son came and cried,</p>
            <p><quote source="Rapunzel's_Prince"><hi rend="italic">Rapunzel, Rapunzel,<lb/> Let down thy hair to me.</hi></quote></p>
            <p>she let the hair down. The King's son ascended, but he did not find his dearest Rapunzel above, but the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.</p>
            <p><quote source="Enchantress">Aha!</quote> she cried mockingly, <quote source="Enchantress">Thou wouldst fetch thy dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out thy eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to thee; thou wilt never see her more.</quote></p>
            <p>The King's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell, pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.</p>
            <p>Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again and he could see with them as before.<note>Rapunzel begs Gothel to allow her to save Rider with her magic hair and Gothel allows it. Rider then cuts off Rapunzel's hair which causes it to turn brown and loose power as well as rapidly age Gothel until she turns to dust. Rapunzel cries over her dying lover and her tears seem to still hold some magic as they heal Rider.</note></p>
             <p>He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully recieved, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.<note>Rapunzel is reunited with her mother and father. Rider and Rapunzel are married.</note></p>
